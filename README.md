# üí´ About Me:
HelloüëãüèΩ. I‚Äôm Sid (he/him), a first year at UNC Chapel Hill with intent to major in Computer Science. <br><br>üíª As an aspiring software developer, my passions lie at the intersection of programming and the natural sciences. I grew fond of engineering in high school through clubs like Science Olympiad where as captain I built functioning model cars and planes, and FIRST Robotics where I learned computer vision programming on python. In 2022 I was accepted to a competitive state-funded 4-week residential summer program at UNC Wilmington where I learned machine learning libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn) for research applications. Now I‚Äôm excited about applying these advanced skills to build mobile apps and develop websites.<br><br>üíâ I‚Äôve been raised with a deep respect for my pharmacist grandfather, a man whose profession single handedly allowed my family the opportunity to reside in the US. Throughout his life he battled cardiovascular issues, so after his passing I was compelled to pursue and publish research for cardiac arrhythmia detection. I‚Äôve used large vital statistics datasets, to observe the correlation between smoking and tuberculosis. Recently I‚Äôve written a short article discussing the need for medical psilocybin legalisation. Currently I‚Äôm looking for research opportunities at the intersection of data science and biology to further pursue my passion for biostatistics. <br><br>üå± My environmentalist activism is rooted in my Hindu value to preserve nature. My love for exploring wilderness has fuelled my advocacy for sustainability. After petitioning the expansion of agricultural beds at my high school, I conducted a series of soil tests on our grounds to provide a recommendation of increasing clay content for longevity. Additionally upon identifying a recycling contamination epidemic at my school, I implemented alternate material collection methods to reduce contamination costs. Currently my interests in sustainability are to work against the fast fashion industry.<br><br>No matter my field of interest I take great pride in helping others.
